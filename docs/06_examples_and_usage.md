# 06. Usage & Examples

`gemini-cli-headless` provides a single, powerful function: `run_gemini_cli_headless()`. It allows you to orchestrate the Gemini CLI programmatically while enforcing strict security boundaries.

## Basic Usage

To run a simple, unrestricted prompt (Not recommended for autonomous execution):

```python
from gemini_cli_headless import run_gemini_cli_headless

session = run_gemini_cli_headless(
    prompt="What is the capital of France?",
    model_id="gemini-3-flash-preview"
)

print(session.text)
# Output: "The capital of France is Paris."
```

## The Zero-Trust Sandbox (Recommended)

When orchestrating autonomous agents, you must enforce boundaries.

### 1. File Sandbox (Whitelisted Path + Specific Tools)

This limits the agent to only reading and replacing text within a specific `/src` folder. It cannot list directories, run shell commands, or touch files outside `/src`.

```python
import os
from gemini_cli_headless import run_gemini_cli_headless

project_root = os.path.abspath("./my_project/src")

session = run_gemini_cli_headless(
    prompt="Refactor the authentication logic in auth.ts.",
    cwd=project_root,
    allowed_tools=["read_file", "replace", "grep_search"],
    allowed_paths=[project_root] # The strict boundary
)
```

### 2. Shell Command Sandboxing

The wrapper uses the engine's native `commandPrefix` feature to surgically restrict `run_shell_command`.

This example allows the model to run `npm test` or `git status`, but physically blocks commands like `rm -rf` or `curl`.

```python
session = run_gemini_cli_headless(
    prompt="Run the tests and tell me if they pass.",
    cwd="./my_project",
    allowed_tools=["run_shell_command"],
    allowed_commands=["npm test", "git status"] # Strict Prefix Whitelist
)
```

### 3. Context Injection (No Tools Required)

If you already have the file contents and want to save tokens by preventing the model from calling `read_file`, you can inject the file directly into the context window. 

The wrapper automatically generates "Invisible Enforcement" notes telling the model it doesn't need tools to read the file.

```python
session = run_gemini_cli_headless(
    prompt="Summarize this error log.",
    files=["./logs/crash_report_500.txt"], # Injected via @ syntax internally
    allowed_tools=[] # Physical paralysis: No tools allowed
)
```

## Advanced: Maintaining State Across Runs

To build complex multi-turn workflows (like a "Plan -> Execute -> Review" loop), you can persist the conversation using `session_id` and `session_to_resume`.

```python
# Turn 1: The Plan
session_1 = run_gemini_cli_headless(
    prompt="Create a plan to build a python calculator.",
    allowed_tools=[]
)

# Turn 2: The Execution (Resuming from Turn 1)
session_2 = run_gemini_cli_headless(
    prompt="Execute step 1 of your plan.",
    allowed_tools=["write_file"],
    allowed_paths=["./calculator_project"],
    session_to_resume=session_1.session_id # Picks up exactly where it left off
)
```

## Understanding the Response Object

The function returns a `GeminiSession` dataclass containing everything you need for orchestration and auditing:

*   `session.text`: The final string response from the model.
*   `session.session_id`: The UUID of the conversation (used for resuming).
*   `session.stats`: Token consumption and high-level tool execution counts.
*   `session.raw_data`: The complete JSON object returned by the CLI, including the `trace.calls` array for surgical auditing of every action the engine took.
